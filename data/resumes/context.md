# Additional Context for AI

This file contains extra context that helps the AI assistant answer questions more personally and accurately.

## Career Story

### Why did you become a software engineer?
I've been passionate about technology since the early days. I graduated with a BS in Computer Science from University of Houston in 1998 and have been building software ever since. What keeps me engaged is the constant evolution - from early Java web apps to modern cloud-native architectures to now AI-assisted development.

### What are you looking for in your next role?
I'm looking for a technical leadership role where I can:
- Lead modernization efforts (I love taking legacy systems and transforming them)
- Continue leveraging AI tools to accelerate development
- Work with a team that values both shipping fast and maintaining quality
- Have ownership over architectural decisions

### What type of company culture do you thrive in?
I do best in environments that:
- Value pragmatism over dogma
- Give engineers autonomy and ownership
- Have a bias for action
- Appreciate experience while staying open to new approaches

## Key Achievements Deep Dives

### MyBA at General Motors
**Context:** GM needed an internal administration app for their business operations
**Challenge:** Build from scratch with a team of 15, deliver in 9 months
**Approach:** Established clear architecture patterns, used Spring Boot + Azure, created reusable components
**Outcome:** Delivered on time, app became critical internal tool
**Learning:** Leading a larger team requires different skills than individual contribution - communication and standards matter as much as code

### CAP Agreements System
**Context:** GM needed a system to handle complex fleet discount logic for major customers
**Challenge:** Highly complex business rules, high data volumes, needed to integrate with multiple systems
**Approach:** Designed flexible architecture that could handle edge cases without becoming unmaintainable
**Outcome:** Became one of the most-used features on the platform
**Learning:** Investing time in understanding the business problem deeply pays off in better technical solutions

### AI-Accelerated Development (Vibe Coding)
**Context:** I wanted to explore how AI tools could change solo development
**Challenge:** Could one person achieve team-level productivity?
**Approach:** Built 3 SaaS apps using Claude Code, Copilot, and other AI tools
**Outcome:** Shipping features 3-5x faster while maintaining quality
**Learning:** AI doesn't replace engineering judgment - it amplifies it. You still need to know what good code looks like.

## Working Style

### Strengths
- Deep experience with enterprise Java/Spring ecosystems
- Strong track record leading teams and delivering complex projects
- Ability to modernize legacy systems incrementally without breaking production
- Early adopter of AI-assisted development with practical results
- Clear communication with both technical and non-technical stakeholders

### Areas of Growth
- Always learning new frontend frameworks (React ecosystem moves fast)
- Continuing to refine AI-assisted workflows
- Balancing hands-on coding with leadership responsibilities

### How do you approach problems?
1. Understand the business context first - why does this matter?
2. Break down the problem into smaller, testable pieces
3. Start with the simplest solution that could work
4. Iterate based on feedback and real-world usage

### How do you handle conflict or disagreement?
I believe in data-driven discussions. When there's disagreement, I try to:
- Understand the other perspective fully
- Find common ground on goals
- Propose experiments or POCs when possible
- Defer to whoever has the most relevant expertise

## Availability & Preferences

### Current Status
- Available: Open to opportunities
- Location preference: Remote or Austin, TX area
- Citizenship: US Citizen

### Role Preferences
- Preferred titles: Technical Lead, Senior Programmer Analyst, Staff Engineer, Engineering Manager
- Team size preference: Mid-size teams where I can have impact
- Industry interests: Open to various industries, especially interested in modernization projects

## Side Projects

### Taskitos
Task management app that "nags" tasks to completion with smart, persistent notifications. Built with Next.js + Supabase.

### ExpandNote
Notes with automation hooks - like "notes + Zapier". Notes can trigger workflows and integrations. Built with Next.js + Supabase.

### PropertyPulse360
Property management for small landlords: rent tracking, expenses, owner distributions, lease-expiry tracking. Built with Next.js + Supabase.

## AI & Automation Expertise

### What AI tools do you use?
I work extensively with multiple AI platforms:
- **Claude (Anthropic)**: My primary AI assistant for complex reasoning, code review, and architectural decisions. I use Claude Code daily for development.
- **OpenAI/ChatGPT**: Use for various tasks including content generation and code assistance
- **GitHub Copilot**: Integrated into my daily coding workflow for autocomplete and suggestions
- **Gemini**: Use for research and alternative perspectives

### What's your experience with Agentic AI?
I'm deep into agentic AI development:
- Use Claude Code as my primary development environment - it's transformed how I build software
- Experience with Cursor IDE for AI-assisted development
- Build applications that integrate LLM APIs (Claude, OpenAI) for intelligent features
- Strong prompt engineering skills from building production AI features

### What workflow automation tools do you use?
I automate everything I can:
- **N8n**: Self-hosted workflow automation for complex integrations and data pipelines
- **Make.com (Integromat)**: Visual automation for connecting apps and services
- **Zapier**: Quick integrations for simpler workflows
- Build custom automation scripts when off-the-shelf tools don't fit

### How do you use AI in your development workflow?
My "vibe coding" approach combines multiple AI tools:
1. Start with Claude Code for architecture and implementation
2. Use Copilot for in-editor autocomplete
3. Leverage N8n/Make.com for deployment and integration automation
4. Result: 3-5x faster feature delivery while maintaining quality

## Fun Facts
- 20+ years in the industry, still excited to learn new things
- Early adopter of AI coding tools - been using them since they became available
- Based in Round Rock, Texas (Austin area)
- University of Houston Computer Science grad (Go Coogs!)
