## Cutting Through the AI Hype

Every day, there's a new "revolutionary" AI tool. Most are:
- Rebranded ChatGPT wrappers
- Solutions looking for problems
- Tools nobody actually uses after the first week

I build AI products for a living (Taskitos and ExpandNote). Here are the tools I **actually** use daily, and why they're worth your time.

## For Coding: Claude + GitHub Copilot

### Claude (Sonnet 3.5)
**What I use it for:**
- Architecture decisions
- Code reviews
- Debugging complex issues
- Writing documentation

**Why Claude over ChatGPT:**
- Better at following complex instructions
- More reliable code output
- Longer context window (200k tokens)
- Understands nuance better

**Real example:**
When building Taskitos' persistent reminder system, I gave Claude my entire codebase context (database schema, API routes, email templates) and asked it to design the escalation logic. It produced production-ready code that I barely had to modify.

### GitHub Copilot
**What I use it for:**
- Autocomplete on steroids
- Writing repetitive code
- Generating test cases
- Boilerplate reduction

**Why it's worth $10/month:**
Saves me **2-3 hours per day** on mundane coding tasks. Do the math: that's $300-500/day of time at a senior dev rate.

<Callout type="tip">
Use Claude for **thinking** and architecture. Use Copilot for **typing** and repetition.
</Callout>

## For Writing: ChatGPT + Grammarly

### ChatGPT (GPT-4)
**What I use it for:**
- First drafts of blog posts
- Email templates
- Social media content
- SEO optimization

**My process:**
1. Brain dump ideas in ExpandNote (voice capture)
2. Feed to ChatGPT as outline
3. Generate first draft
4. Edit heavily (add personality, cut fluff)

**Critical point:** AI writes generic content. **You** add the unique insights and voice.

### Grammarly
**What I use it for:**
- Catching grammar mistakes
- Tone adjustment
- Clarity suggestions

Not technically AI, but uses ML. Worth the $12/month if you write daily.

## For Product Development: My Own Tools + OpenAI API

### Taskitos (Task Management)
**What it does:**
- AI parses natural language tasks
- Voice-to-task with Whisper
- Smart rescheduling with GPT-4o-mini

**Why I built it:**
Existing tools were passive. Taskitos actively ensures you complete tasks with behavioral science + AI.

**AI integration:**
```javascript
// Natural language task parsing
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: TASK_PARSER_PROMPT },
    { role: "user", content: userInput }
  ]
})
```

**Cost:** ~$0.001 per task creation. Scales beautifully.

### ExpandNote (Note-Taking)
**What it does:**
- Voice-to-text with Whisper
- AI Profiles (custom prompts triggered by tags)
- Supports OpenAI, Claude, and 40+ models via OpenRouter

**Why I built it:**
Notes are useless if you never process them. AI Profiles automate the processing.

**Example AI Profile:**
```
Tag: #meeting
Prompt: "Extract:
- Decisions made
- Action items with owners
- Follow-up needed
Format as checklist."
```

Every meeting note automatically becomes actionable.

## For Learning: NotebookLM + YouTube Transcript Tools

### NotebookLM (Google)
**What I use it for:**
- Summarizing technical documentation
- Creating study guides from PDFs
- Generating "podcast" overviews of dense content

**Why it's underrated:**
It's **free**, processes entire documents, and creates surprisingly good audio summaries.

**Real use case:**
When learning Next.js 15, I fed NotebookLM the entire documentation. It generated a 20-minute "podcast" explaining the key changes. Listened during my commute.

### YouTube Transcript + ChatGPT
**The combo:**
1. Get transcript of technical video
2. Feed to ChatGPT
3. "Summarize in bullets with code examples"

**Result:** 45-minute video → 5-minute read with actionable takeaways.

## For Email: Superhuman + Claude

### Superhuman
**What it does:**
- AI-powered email triage
- Smart scheduling
- Snippet expansion

**Worth $30/month?**
If you handle 50+ emails daily, yes. Otherwise, stick with Gmail + Claude.

### Claude for Email Drafts
**My workflow:**
1. Bullet point what I want to say
2. Claude: "Make this professional but friendly"
3. Send (after quick review)

**Time saved:** 15-20 minutes daily on email composition.

## AI Tools I Tried and Ditched

### ❌ Notion AI
**Why I left:** Slow, expensive, and didn't add value over ChatGPT.

### ❌ Jasper/Copy.ai
**Why I left:** Generic output, obvious AI writing. Better to use ChatGPT directly.

### ❌ Various "AI Productivity Apps"
**Why I left:** Over-engineered. Simpler to integrate OpenAI API into existing tools.

<Callout type="warning">
Most AI tools are ChatGPT/Claude wrappers with fancy UIs. Save money and use the APIs directly when possible.
</Callout>

## My AI Budget Breakdown

| Tool | Cost/Month | Worth It? |
|------|------------|-----------|
| GitHub Copilot | $10 | ✅ Yes |
| ChatGPT Plus | $20 | ✅ Yes |
| Claude Pro | $20 | ✅ Yes |
| OpenAI API | ~$50 | ✅ Yes |
| Grammarly | $12 | ✅ Yes |
| NotebookLM | Free | ✅ Yes |
| **Total** | **$112** | **2-3 hours saved daily** |

**ROI:** If you value your time at $50/hour, you're saving $100-150 worth of time **per day**. The tools pay for themselves in the first day.

## How to Choose AI Tools

### Ask These Questions:
1. **Does it save time on tasks I do daily?**
   - If no → Skip it
   - If yes → Try free version first

2. **Could I do this with ChatGPT/Claude + 10 minutes of setup?**
   - If yes → Don't pay for the wrapper
   - If no → Consider the specialized tool

3. **Will I still use this in 3 months?**
   - If unsure → Use free tier first
   - If certain → Commit to paid

### Red Flags:
- "AI-powered" with no explanation of what AI does
- Promises to "10x your productivity" (scam language)
- No free tier or trial period
- Startup with unclear business model

## The Future: Agentic AI

The next wave isn't more chatbots. It's **AI agents** that:
- Take actions on your behalf
- Integrate with your tools
- Make decisions within constraints

I'm building this into Taskitos v2:
- AI agent that reschedules your day when meetings run late
- Proactive task suggestions based on calendar openings
- Automatic task breakdown for complex projects

We're moving from AI that **suggests** to AI that **executes**.

## Start Here

If you're new to AI tools, start with this stack:
1. **ChatGPT Plus** ($20/mo) - General purpose
2. **GitHub Copilot** ($10/mo) - If you code
3. **NotebookLM** (Free) - For learning

Total: $30/month

Once you see the value, layer on specialized tools.
