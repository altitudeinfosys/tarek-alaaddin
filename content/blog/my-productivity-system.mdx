## The Problem with Productivity Advice

Most productivity content is garbage. It's either:
1. Over-complicated systems that take longer to maintain than actual work
2. Motivational fluff without actionable steps
3. Advice from people who don't actually build things

I'm a software engineer who ships real products while working full-time. Here's the system I actually use.

## The Core Principles

My productivity system is built on three principles:

### 1. Capture Everything, Trust the System
Your brain is for thinking, not storage. If it's in your head, you're wasting mental energy tracking it.

**Tool:** ExpandNote for quick captures

I use ExpandNote because it has voice-to-text. I can capture thoughts instantly without breaking flow. The AI Profiles feature then processes them automatically (more on this later).

### 2. Three Tasks Rule
You can only make real progress on **3 major tasks per day**. Anything more is self-deception.

**Tool:** Taskitos in Extreme Focus Mode

Taskitos forces me to pick my top 3 priorities. Everything else goes to "Later" bucket. This single change increased my actual completion rate from 40% to 92%.

<Callout type="warning">
If you have 10 "priorities," you have zero priorities. Pick three. Do them. Then pick three more.
</Callout>

### 3. Make Decisions Once
Every decision costs mental energy. Automate, template, or systematize anything you do more than twice.

**Tool:** ExpandNote AI Profiles

I have AI Profiles that:
- Convert meeting notes to action items (tag: `#meeting`)
- Summarize articles for later reference (tag: `#article`)
- Extract coding insights from technical notes (tag: `#code`)

## The Daily System

### Morning (6:00 - 7:00 AM)

**1. Brain Dump (5 minutes)**
- Open ExpandNote
- Voice dump everything in my head
- Don't organize yet, just capture

**2. Task Review (10 minutes)**
- Open Taskitos
- Review yesterday's completions (celebrate wins!)
- Pick today's Top 3 from pending tasks
- Everything else stays in Later

**3. Time Blocking (5 minutes)**
- Block calendar for Deep Work (usually 9-12)
- Block lunch and walks (non-negotiable)
- Leave gaps for reactive work

### During the Day (Work Hours)

**Deep Work Blocks (3-4 hours)**
- Phone on Do Not Disturb
- Close all notifications
- Work on ONE task from my Top 3
- Use Pomodoro (25 min work, 5 min break)

**Reactive Time (2-3 hours)**
- Meetings
- Email responses
- Quick Slack replies
- Code reviews

**Quick Capture (Throughout)**
Whenever a thought pops up:
1. Voice capture in ExpandNote
2. Don't context switch to organize it
3. Keep working

### Evening (6:00 - 7:00 PM)

**Daily Review (10 minutes)**
- Mark completed tasks in Taskitos (feels amazing!)
- Process ExpandNote captures
- Pick tomorrow's Top 3
- One sentence journal entry

**No Work After 7 PM**
Downtime isn't lazy. It's when your brain processes ideas. Some of my best insights come during evening walks, not at my desk.

## Weekly System

### Sunday Planning (30 minutes)

**1. Weekly Review**
- What shipped last week?
- What blocked me?
- What did I learn?

**2. Week Planning**
- Define 3 weekly goals
- Break them into daily tasks
- Schedule Deep Work blocks

**3. Cleanup**
- Archive completed ExpandNote notes
- Clear Taskitos done list
- Review and adjust priorities

## The Tools in Action

### ExpandNote: The Capture System

**Why it works:**
- Voice capture is faster than typing
- AI Profiles process notes automatically
- Offline-first (works anywhere)
- Syncs across devices

**My AI Profiles:**
```
Tag: #meeting
Prompt: "Extract action items with owners and deadlines."

Tag: #article
Prompt: "Summarize key points in 3 bullets."

Tag: #idea
Prompt: "Evaluate feasibility and list next steps."
```

### Taskitos: The Execution System

**Why it works:**
- Forces me to pick Top 3 daily
- Persistent reminders until tasks are done
- Auto-reschedules missed tasks
- Email actions (complete from inbox)

**My Setup:**
- Extreme Focus Mode: ON
- Quiet Hours: 10 PM - 6 AM
- Email reminders: ON
- Auto-reschedule: ON

## Productivity Mistakes I Fixed

### Mistake 1: Too Many Tools
**Before:** Notion, Todoist, Evernote, Google Keep, Trello
**After:** ExpandNote + Taskitos + Calendar

Fewer tools = less context switching = more done.

### Mistake 2: Planning Too Much
**Before:** Spent 2 hours planning the week
**After:** 30 minutes Sunday planning, 10 minutes daily review

Planning feels productive but isn't. **Doing** is productive.

### Mistake 3: No Task Limits
**Before:** 20 tasks per day (completed 4)
**After:** 3 tasks per day (completed 3)

Constraints force prioritization. Unlimited tasks create overwhelm.

### Mistake 4: Passive Task Manager
**Before:** Tasks would sit ignored for weeks
**After:** Taskitos nags until tasks are done

If you can ignore a task, your system is broken.

## The Results

Since implementing this system:
- **92% task completion rate** (up from 40%)
- **Shipped 2 SaaS products** (Taskitos and ExpandNote) while working full-time
- **2-3 blog posts per month** consistently
- **Still have evenings and weekends free**

## Try This System

Want to try this productivity system yourself?

1. **Start with Taskitos** - Force yourself to pick only 3 tasks daily
2. **Add ExpandNote** - Set up AI Profiles for your common note types
3. **Track for 2 weeks** - Measure your completion rate

You don't need a perfect system. You need a system you'll actually use.
