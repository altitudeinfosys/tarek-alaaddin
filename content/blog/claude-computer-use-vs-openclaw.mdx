Three days ago, Anthropic shipped Remote Control for Claude Code. You scan a QR code, and your terminal session — with full access to your filesystem, MCP servers, and project config — is now controllable from your phone. Your files never leave your machine. Only the conversation flows through the cloud.

Meanwhile, OpenClaw has been offering something superficially similar since January: an open-source AI agent you control from Signal, Telegram, or WhatsApp. It hit 140,000 GitHub stars in weeks. It also had 230 malicious skills in its marketplace, a critical RCE vulnerability, and 21,639 publicly exposed instances leaking API keys.

Same promise. Radically different execution. Here's what I've learned from using both approaches.

## What Claude Code Remote Control Actually Is

Remote Control launched on February 25, 2026 as a research preview. It's a synchronization layer that connects your local Claude Code terminal session to the Claude mobile app (iOS and Android) or claude.ai/code in any browser.

The setup takes about ten seconds:

```bash
claude remote-control
```

That's it. Your terminal displays a session URL and a QR code. Scan it with your phone. You're now controlling a full Claude Code session — with access to your local filesystem, your MCP servers, your project configuration, everything — from your couch, your commute, or a coffee shop.

Or if you're already mid-session and want to pick it up on your phone:

```
/rc
```

The key architectural decision: **everything runs locally**. Your Claude Code process stays running on your machine. Remote Control just routes the conversation through Anthropic's API over TLS. Your machine makes outbound HTTPS requests only — no inbound ports opened, no VPN needed, no port forwarding.

If your laptop sleeps or your network drops, the session reconnects automatically when you're back online. If you're offline for more than about 10 minutes, the session times out and you run `claude remote-control` again.

**Availability**: Remote Control is currently a research preview on Max plans, with Pro plan support coming soon. It's not yet available on Team or Enterprise plans. You need Claude Code version 2.1.52 or later.

## What OpenClaw Is (And Its Wild Ride to 140K Stars)

OpenClaw is a free, open-source AI agent created by Peter Steinberger, the founder of PSPDFKit. Like Claude Code Remote Control, it lets you control an AI agent from your phone — but the similarities end there.

The naming history tells you everything about how fast this space moves. Steinberger launched it as **Clawdbot** in November 2025. Anthropic sent a trademark complaint. He renamed it to **Moltbot** in late January 2026. That name lasted three days before he decided it didn't roll off the tongue. **OpenClaw** stuck.

The project went viral. 140,000 GitHub stars and 20,000 forks within weeks. People started buying Mac Minis to run dedicated OpenClaw instances. On February 14, 2026, Steinberger announced he was joining OpenAI, and the project would move to an open-source foundation.

OpenClaw is model-agnostic — it works with Claude, GPT, DeepSeek, or local models. It ships with over 100 preconfigured AgentSkills and can autonomously write new skills. You interact with it through Signal, Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, Slack, or iMessage. It maintains persistent memory across conversations using local Markdown files and connects to 50+ third-party integrations including smart home hardware.

The pitch is compelling: text your AI agent from anywhere, and it handles everything on your machine. No terminal required.

## The Architecture Difference That Changes Everything

Both tools let you control AI from your phone. The architecture underneath could not be more different.

**Claude Code Remote Control: Your Machine, Your Rules**

```text
Your Terminal → Runs Claude Code locally
Claude Code → Makes outbound HTTPS to Anthropic API
Anthropic API → Routes conversation to Claude mobile app
You (on phone) → Send messages, approve actions
Claude Code → Executes locally on your machine
```

Your files stay on your machine. Your MCP servers keep running locally. The mobile app is just a window into your local session. You can work from terminal and phone simultaneously — the conversation stays in sync across all connected devices.

**OpenClaw: The Agent Runs Autonomously**

```text
You → Send message via Signal/Telegram/WhatsApp
OpenClaw → Receives message on your machine
OpenClaw → Decides what to do autonomously
OpenClaw → Executes shell commands, browser actions, file ops
OpenClaw → Responds via messaging app
```

OpenClaw runs on your machine with whatever permissions you give it. In full mode, it reads your files, executes shell commands, controls your browser, installs software, and can even write new skills for itself. The messaging app isn't a window into a controlled session — it's a command interface to an autonomous agent.

This is the fundamental tradeoff: **Claude Code Remote Control gives you a remote window into a controlled session. OpenClaw gives you a remote trigger for an autonomous agent.**

<Callout type="warning">
**Why this distinction matters**: With Remote Control, you see every action before it happens and approve it through the same permission model you use in the terminal. With OpenClaw, the agent decides what to do and tells you what it did. The difference between those two sentences is the entire security story.

## Security: This Is Where It Gets Real

### Claude Code Remote Control's Security Model

Anthropic designed Remote Control with paranoia baked into the architecture:

- **Outbound only**: your machine makes outbound HTTPS requests. No inbound ports. No attack surface for port scanning or direct exploitation.
- **TLS transport**: all traffic goes through the Anthropic API over TLS — the same encryption as any Claude Code session.
- **Short-lived credentials**: the connection uses multiple short-lived credentials, each scoped to a single purpose and expiring independently.
- **Same permission model**: whatever permission settings you use in your terminal (ask mode, auto-approve, sandbox mode) carry over to the remote session. Nothing gets elevated just because you're on your phone.
- **One session at a time**: each Claude Code instance supports one remote connection, limiting the blast radius of any compromise.

The security model works because Remote Control doesn't add new capabilities — it just adds a new interface to existing ones. Your Claude Code session has the same power and the same constraints whether you're at your keyboard or on your phone.

### OpenClaw's Security Track Record

OpenClaw's security story is a cautionary tale about what happens when adoption outpaces security engineering by orders of magnitude.

Within three weeks of going viral, three major security incidents hit:

**CVE-2026-25253** (CVSS 8.8) — OpenClaw's Control UI accepted a `gatewayUrl` parameter from the URL without validation and transmitted the user's authentication token to whatever address was specified. One malicious link gave an attacker full control of your OpenClaw instance. Security researchers found **21,639 publicly exposed instances** via Censys scans, many leaking API keys and plaintext credentials.

**The ClawHavoc Supply Chain Attack** — 230 malicious skills were found in OpenClaw's skill marketplace (ClawHub). These skills performed data exfiltration, credential theft, and remote code execution while appearing legitimate. The marketplace lacked adequate vetting.

**Cisco's Assessment** — Cisco's AI security research team documented silent data exfiltration via embedded curl commands in third-party skills. The agent executed network calls without any user awareness.

A related project, Moltbook (a social network for OpenClaw agents), exposed 35,000 email addresses and 1.5 million agent API tokens through an unsecured database.

The project has since added VirusTotal scanning and patched the CVE. But these incidents reveal a structural problem: when you build an agent that can autonomously execute arbitrary code and connect to third-party skills from an unvetted marketplace, security isn't a feature you bolt on later.

<Callout type="info">
**The contrast in approach**: Anthropic ships Remote Control as a research preview on premium plans, gathers feedback, and expands access gradually. OpenClaw shipped with full system access, an unvetted skill marketplace, and no security review — then scrambled to add guardrails after 300,000 people were already using it.
</Callout>

## Practicality: What Can You Actually Do From Your Phone?

### Claude Code Remote Control

I've been using Remote Control since it launched three days ago. Here's what works well:

- **Long-running tasks**: Start a refactor at your desk, check progress from your phone while making dinner. The session persists even if your laptop lid is closed (it reconnects when opened).
- **Code review on the go**: Ask Claude to explain a function, review a PR, or summarize recent changes — all from your phone while walking to lunch.
- **Deploy monitoring**: Kick off a build or deployment, then monitor output from your phone.
- **Quick fixes**: Spot a bug in production, pull up the Remote Control session on your phone, and have Claude fix it while you're away from your desk.

Where it's limited: you need your machine running. If your laptop is powered off or you don't have network access for more than 10 minutes, the session dies. It's a remote window, not a replacement for your workstation.

### OpenClaw

OpenClaw's messaging interface makes different things easy:

- **Conversational triggers**: "Turn off the living room lights" via Signal feels more natural than typing a command.
- **Personal automation**: Calendar management, email triage, file organization — tasks that benefit from persistent context.
- **Smart home integration**: 50+ integrations with home automation, productivity tools, and communication platforms.
- **Self-extending**: It can write new skills for tasks it hasn't seen before.

Where it's limited: the same autonomy that makes it convenient makes it dangerous. Every skill execution is a trust decision. Every integration is an attack vector.

## The Cron Question: Scheduling AI Agents

One of the most requested features in AI agent tooling is scheduled execution. Neither tool ships native scheduling, but the ecosystem has solutions.

### Claude Code Scheduling

| Tool | Approach | Key Feature |
|------|----------|-------------|
| runCLAUDErun | Native macOS app | GUI-based scheduling |
| claude-tasks | TUI scheduler | 6-field cron expressions, Discord/Slack webhooks |
| claude-code-scheduler | CLI tool | Natural language scheduling, cross-platform |
| GitHub Actions | CI/CD pipeline | Anthropic's official `claude-code-action` |

There's an active feature request (GitHub issue #4785) for native cron-like functionality in Claude Code. With Remote Control now allowing persistent sessions and background tasks already shipping in v2.0.60, native scheduling feels inevitable.

I run my content pipeline on a manual trigger today, but the GitHub Actions approach is the most production-ready path for automated runs.

### OpenClaw's Approach

OpenClaw supports proactive automation through its long-term memory system — you can configure it to watch for conditions and act automatically. The tradeoff is the same as everything else: more autonomy means more trust required, and that trust has been repeatedly violated.

## What I Expect From Anthropic Next

Anthropic is investing heavily in making AI agents that actually work on your machine. Here's what I think is coming based on the trajectory:

**Remote Control expanding to Pro and Team plans.** The research preview is the testing phase. The feature is too useful to keep limited to Max.

**Native scheduling in Claude Code.** Remote Control + background tasks + sub-agents = all the infrastructure for scheduled execution. Adding cron-like triggers is a natural next step.

**Computer Use integration with Claude Code.** On February 25, Anthropic also acquired Vercept, a Seattle startup whose VyUI product outperformed competitors on UI grounding benchmarks. Vercept had raised $50M and their team of nine joins Anthropic. Combine that with Remote Control and you can imagine controlling visual desktop automation from your phone.

**More guardrails, not fewer.** Anthropic's consistent pattern is adding safety before expanding capabilities. Remote Control inherits the existing permission model by design. Expect this discipline to continue.

## The Bottom Line

Claude Code Remote Control and OpenClaw represent two competing visions for AI you can control from your phone:

**Remote Control** says: your session runs locally, you see and approve every action, your files never leave your machine, and the mobile interface is a window — not a backdoor. The permission model is the same one you already trust in your terminal.

**OpenClaw** says: the agent should be autonomous, accessible from any messaging app, and capable of extending itself. It's more convenient. It's also responsible for one of the largest AI security incidents of 2026 — 230 malicious skills, 21,639 exposed instances, and a supply chain attack that affected 300,000 users.

For me, the choice is clear. I use Claude Code Remote Control for real work. The three-day-old feature already handles everything I need: start tasks at my desk, check on them from my phone, approve actions with the same permission model I use locally.

The future of mobile AI control isn't about giving agents more autonomy. It's about giving humans better windows into agents they already trust. Remote Control gets that right.
